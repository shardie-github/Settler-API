# Org "Second Brain," Learning, Knowledge Network
## Settler Strategic Framework 2026-2031

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026  
**Status:** Strategic Planning Document

---

## Executive Summary

This document proposes systems and playbooks for Settler to never lose internal learning. We design a "second brain" that captures decisions, knowledge, and patterns, ensuring institutional knowledge persists even as the team grows and changes.

**Key Principles:**
- **Living Decision Logs:** Every decision is documented with context, rationale, and outcomes
- **Fork-Friendly Documentation:** Knowledge is version-controlled, forkable, and remixable
- **Adversarial & Canonical Records:** Capture both "how we ship" and "how we react/learn"
- **AI-Driven Knowledge Base:** LLM-powered assistant for internal knowledge discovery

- **Adversarial Records:** "How we react/learn" (incidents, failures, lessons learned)

### Canonical Records: "How We Ship"

**Purpose:** Document standard processes, best practices, patterns.

**Examples:**
- How we deploy (CI/CD pipeline, deployment process)
- How we code review (review process, standards)
- How we test (testing strategy, test coverage)
- How we design (design system, UI patterns)

**Format:**
```markdown
# How We [Process]

## Standard Process
[Step-by-step process]

## Best Practices
[What works well?]

## Anti-Patterns
[What to avoid?]

## Examples
[Real examples from codebase]

## Related
[Links to related processes]
```

### Adversarial Records: "How We React/Learn"

**Purpose:** Document incidents, failures, lessons learned.

**Examples:**
- Post-mortems (incident analysis, root cause, prevention)
- Retrospectives (what went well, what didn't, improvements)
- Failure modes (common failures, how to prevent)

**Format:**
```markdown
# Incident: [Title]

**Date:** 2026-01-15
**Severity:** [Low | Medium | High | Critical]
**Duration:** [How long did it last?]
**Impact:** [How many customers affected?]

## Timeline
[Chronological timeline of events]

## Root Cause
[What caused the incident?]

## Resolution
[How was it resolved?]

## Prevention
[How do we prevent this in the future?]

## Lessons Learned
[What did we learn?]

## Related
[Links to related incidents, decisions]
```

### Implementation

**Tools:**
- **GitHub Issues:** For incident tracking
- **Post-Mortem Templates:** Standardized format
- **Retrospective Templates:** Standardized format
- **AI Assistant:** Generate post-mortems from incident logs

**Process:**
1. **Incident Occurs:** Documented in GitHub Issue
2. **Post-Mortem:** Written within 1 week (standardized template)
3. **Lessons Learned:** Incorporated into processes, documentation
4. **Prevention:** Changes made to prevent recurrence

**Success Metrics:**
