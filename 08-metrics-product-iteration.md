## Product Metrics & KPIs

### Activation Metrics

**Definition:** User completes key actions that indicate they've derived value from Settler.

**Key Actions:**
1. **Account Created** - User signs up
2. **API Key Generated** - User gets API key
3. **First Job Created** - User creates reconciliation job
4. **First Reconciliation Run** - User runs reconciliation
5. **First Report Viewed** - User views results

**Activation Rate:**
```
Activation Rate = Users who completed all 5 actions / Total signups
Target: 60%+
```

**Funnel:**
```
Signups → API Key Generated → Job Created → Reconciliation Run → Report Viewed
100%     → 80%                → 60%         → 50%                → 40%
```

**SQL Query:**
```sql
-- Activation funnel
WITH activation_steps AS (
  SELECT
    u.id as user_id,
    u.created_at as signup_date,
    CASE WHEN ak.id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as has_api_key,
    CASE WHEN j.id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as has_job,
    CASE WHEN e.id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as has_execution,
    CASE WHEN r.id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as has_report
  FROM users u
  LEFT JOIN api_keys ak ON u.id = ak.user_id
  LEFT JOIN jobs j ON u.id = j.user_id
  LEFT JOIN executions e ON j.id = e.job_id
  LEFT JOIN reports r ON j.id = r.job_id
  WHERE u.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
)
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_signups,
  SUM(has_api_key) as api_key_generated,
  SUM(has_job) as job_created,
  SUM(has_execution) as reconciliation_run,
  SUM(has_report) as report_viewed,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(has_report) / COUNT(*), 2) as activation_rate
FROM activation_steps;
```

### Onboarding Dropoff Metrics

**Definition:** Where users drop off during onboarding.

**Dropoff Points:**
1. **After Signup** - User doesn't generate API key
2. **After API Key** - User doesn't create job
3. **After Job Creation** - User doesn't run reconciliation
4. **After First Run** - User doesn't view report

**Dropoff Rate:**
```
Dropoff Rate = Users who drop off at step X / Users who reached step X
```

**SQL Query:**
```sql
-- Onboarding dropoff analysis
WITH user_journey AS (
  SELECT
    u.id,
    u.created_at,
    MIN(ak.created_at) as api_key_date,
    MIN(j.created_at) as job_date,
    MIN(e.created_at) as execution_date,
    MIN(r.created_at) as report_date
  FROM users u
  LEFT JOIN api_keys ak ON u.id = ak.user_id
  LEFT JOIN jobs j ON u.id = j.user_id
  LEFT JOIN executions e ON j.id = e.job_id
  LEFT JOIN reports r ON j.id = r.job_id
  WHERE u.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
  GROUP BY u.id, u.created_at
)
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_signups,
  COUNT(api_key_date) as reached_api_key,
  COUNT(job_date) as reached_job,
  COUNT(execution_date) as reached_execution,
  COUNT(report_date) as reached_report,
  ROUND(100.0 * (COUNT(*) - COUNT(api_key_date)) / COUNT(*), 2) as dropoff_after_signup,
  ROUND(100.0 * (COUNT(api_key_date) - COUNT(job_date)) / COUNT(api_key_date), 2) as dropoff_after_api_key,
  ROUND(100.0 * (COUNT(job_date) - COUNT(execution_date)) / COUNT(job_date), 2) as dropoff_after_job,
  ROUND(100.0 * (COUNT(execution_date) - COUNT(report_date)) / COUNT(execution_date), 2) as dropoff_after_execution
FROM user_journey;
```

### Reconciliation/Job Success Rate

**Definition:** Percentage of reconciliation jobs that complete successfully.

**Success Rate:**
```
Success Rate = Successful Executions / Total Executions
Target: >95%
```

**SQL Query:**
```sql
-- Reconciliation success rate
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as total_executions,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as successful,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'failed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as failed,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as success_rate
FROM executions
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

**By Job:**
```sql
-- Success rate by job
SELECT
  j.id,
  j.name,
  COUNT(e.id) as total_executions,
  SUM(CASE WHEN e.status = 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as successful,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN e.status = 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(e.id), 2) as success_rate
FROM jobs j
LEFT JOIN executions e ON j.id = e.job_id
WHERE j.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY j.id, j.name
HAVING COUNT(e.id) > 0
ORDER BY success_rate ASC;
```

### Error Rates

**Definition:** Percentage of operations that result in errors.

**Error Types:**
1. **API Errors** - 4xx/5xx HTTP errors
2. **Reconciliation Errors** - Failed reconciliations
3. **Webhook Errors** - Failed webhook deliveries
4. **Adapter Errors** - Adapter-specific errors

**Error Rate:**
```
Error Rate = Errors / Total Operations
Target: <1%
```

**SQL Query:**
```sql
-- API error rate
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('hour', timestamp) as hour,
  COUNT(*) as total_requests,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status_code >= 400 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as errors,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN status_code >= 400 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as error_rate
FROM audit_logs
WHERE timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('hour', timestamp)
ORDER BY hour DESC;
```

**By Error Type:**
```sql
-- Error breakdown by type
SELECT
  error_type,
  COUNT(*) as error_count,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) as percentage
FROM audit_logs
WHERE status_code >= 400
  AND timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY error_type
ORDER BY error_count DESC;
```

### Feedback Response Time

**Definition:** Time to respond to user feedback (support tickets, feature requests, etc.).

**Response Time:**
```
Response Time = Time to first response
Target: <24 hours
```

**SQL Query:**
```sql
-- Feedback response time
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as total_feedback,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (first_response_at - created_at)) / 3600) as avg_response_hours,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (first_response_at - created_at)) / 3600) as median_response_hours
FROM feedback
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
  AND first_response_at IS NOT NULL

## Hypotheses & Experiments

### Hypothesis Framework

**Format:**
```
We believe that [doing X] will result in [outcome Y] because [reason Z].

We'll know we're right when [metric M] [changes by N%].
```

**Example:**
```
We believe that adding a "Quick Start" tutorial will increase activation rate because new users need guidance.

We'll know we're right when activation rate increases from 40% to 60% within 2 weeks.
```

---

### Top Hypotheses to Test

#### Hypothesis 1: Onboarding Tutorial Increases Activation

**Hypothesis:**
```
We believe that adding an interactive onboarding tutorial will increase activation rate because new users need step-by-step guidance.

We'll know we're right when activation rate increases from 40% to 60% within 2 weeks.
```

**Experiment:**
- **Control:** Current onboarding (no tutorial)
- **Variant:** Onboarding with interactive tutorial
- **Split:** 50/50 A/B test
- **Duration:** 2 weeks
- **Sample Size:** 100 users per variant

**Metrics:**
- Activation rate
- Time to activation
- Dropoff at each step

**Success Criteria:**
- Activation rate increases by 20%+
- Time to activation decreases by 30%+

---

#### Hypothesis 2: Pre-built Templates Increase Job Creation

**Hypothesis:**
```
We believe that offering pre-built job templates (Shopify-Stripe, QuickBooks-PayPal, etc.) will increase job creation rate because users don't need to configure from scratch.

We'll know we're right when job creation rate increases from 60% to 80% within 2 weeks.
```

**Experiment:**
- **Control:** Manual job creation (current)
- **Variant:** Template-based job creation
- **Split:** 50/50 A/B test
- **Duration:** 2 weeks

**Metrics:**
- Job creation rate
- Time to first job
- Template usage rate

**Success Criteria:**
- Job creation rate increases by 20%+
- Time to first job decreases by 50%+

---

#### Hypothesis 3: In-App Help Reduces Support Tickets

**Hypothesis:**
```
We believe that adding contextual help tooltips and documentation links will reduce support tickets because users can self-serve.

We'll know we're right when support ticket volume decreases by 30% within 1 month.
```

**Experiment:**
- **Control:** Current UI (no help tooltips)
- **Variant:** UI with contextual help
- **Split:** 50/50 A/B test
- **Duration:** 1 month

**Metrics:**
- Support ticket volume
- Help tooltip clicks
- Documentation page views

**Success Criteria:**
- Support ticket volume decreases by 30%+
- Help tooltip click rate > 20%

---

#### Hypothesis 4: Email Reminders Increase Re-engagement

**Hypothesis:**
```
We believe that sending email reminders to inactive users will increase re-engagement because users forget about Settler.

We'll know we're right when re-engagement rate increases from 10% to 25% within 1 month.
```

**Experiment:**
- **Control:** No email reminders
- **Variant:** Email reminders after 7 days of inactivity
- **Split:** 50/50 A/B test
- **Duration:** 1 month

**Metrics:**
- Re-engagement rate (users who return after reminder)
- Email open rate
- Email click rate

**Success Criteria:**
- Re-engagement rate increases by 15%+
- Email open rate > 30%

---

#### Hypothesis 5: Free Tier Limits Increase Conversions

**Hypothesis:**
```
We believe that reducing free tier limits (from 1,000 to 100 reconciliations/month) will increase paid conversions because users hit limits faster.

We'll know we're right when conversion rate increases from 5% to 10% within 1 month.
```

**Experiment:**
- **Control:** Current free tier (1,000 reconciliations/month)
- **Variant:** Reduced free tier (100 reconciliations/month)
- **Split:** 50/50 A/B test
- **Duration:** 1 month

**Metrics:**
- Conversion rate (free → paid)
- Time to conversion
- Churn rate

**Success Criteria:**
- Conversion rate increases by 5%+
- No increase in churn rate
