## Executive Summary

Settler's open source strategy is designed to build a vibrant developer community, accelerate adoption, and create network effects through composable adapters and developer-first tooling.

**Core Principles:**
1. **Open by Default:** SDKs and adapters open source, core engine proprietary

## Open Source Strategy

### What's Open Source

**Open Source (MIT License):**
- ✅ TypeScript SDK (`@settler/sdk`)

### Why This Model?

**Benefits:**
