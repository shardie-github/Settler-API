## Slide 3: Why Existing Solutions Fail

**Headline:**  
The Gap in the Market

**Visual:**  
- Competitive matrix table
- Visual showing where Settler fits

**Content:**

| Solution | Why It Fails |
|----------|--------------|
| **QuickBooks/Xero** | Manual process, no real-time, limited API |
| **Stripe Revenue Recognition** | Stripe-only, no multi-platform |
| **Fivetran** | Not purpose-built for reconciliation, expensive |
| **Custom Scripts** | High maintenance, no compliance, brittle |
| **BlackLine** | Expensive ($100K+), complex, slow onboarding |

**The Gap:** No API-first, real-time, composable reconciliation service.

**Speaker Notes:**
- QuickBooks/Xero: Manual, not real-time, limited API
- Stripe: Single-platform, not multi-platform
- Fivetran: Not purpose-built, expensive, requires data warehouse
- Custom Scripts: High maintenance, no compliance, brittle
- BlackLine: Expensive ($100K+), complex, 6-month setup
- **The gap:** No API-first competitor exists - this is our opportunity

**Competitive Moat:**
- API-first architecture (competitors are UI-first)
- Real-time reconciliation (competitors are batch-based)
- Composable adapters (competitors are closed systems)
- Developer experience (5-minute integration vs. weeks/months)
