### Settler: Reconciliation Automation for E-commerce and SaaS

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Target Audience:** Non-technical executives, investors, decision-makers

---

### What is Settler?

Settler is an API-first reconciliation platform that automates matching records across disconnected systems (Shopify orders with Stripe payments, QuickBooks invoices with PayPal transactions, etc.). Think of it as "Resend for reconciliation"—dead-simple onboarding, pure API, usage-based pricing.

---

### The Problem We Solve

**Manual reconciliation is expensive and error-prone:**
- Finance teams spend 10-20 hours per week manually matching records
- Human error leads to incorrect financial reports (5-10% error rate)

**Fragmented data across platforms:**
- Orders in Shopify, payments in Stripe, accounting in QuickBooks
- Each system has different APIs, data formats, and update frequencies
- Building custom integrations is time-consuming and brittle

---

### Our Solution

**Automated reconciliation with 99%+ accuracy:**
1. **Connect systems** in 5 minutes via API
2. **Set matching rules** (amount, date, ID, custom logic)
3. **Run reconciliation** automatically (scheduled or on-demand)
4. **Get results** via API, webhooks, or dashboard

**Key features:**
- Pre-built adapters for 50+ platforms (Stripe, Shopify, QuickBooks, PayPal, etc.)
- Configurable matching rules with confidence scoring
- Real-time webhook notifications
- Complete audit trail and detailed reports
- API-first design (use from any language, any framework)
