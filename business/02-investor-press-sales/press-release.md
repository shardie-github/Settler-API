## Settler Launches Reconciliation-as-a-Service API, Eliminating Hours of Manual Financial Data Matching

**New API-first platform automates reconciliation across Stripe, Shopify, QuickBooks, and 50+ platforms with 5-minute integration**

**SAN FRANCISCO, CA — [DATE]** — Settler, a reconciliation-as-a-service (RaaS) platform, today announced its public launch, enabling businesses to automate financial data reconciliation across fragmented SaaS and e-commerce ecosystems through a single API.

Modern businesses operate across 10+ platforms—Stripe for payments, Shopify for orders, QuickBooks for accounting, NetSuite for ERP—each with its own data format, timing, and quirks. Finance teams spend 2-3 hours daily manually reconciling transactions, hunting for mismatches, and fixing errors, causing revenue leakage, compliance risks, and operational overhead.

Settler eliminates this pain with a 5-minute API integration that normalizes, validates, and reconciles data across all platforms in real-time.

**"We built Settler because we lived the pain,"** said [Founder Name], CEO and co-founder of Settler. **"As a CTO of a fast-growing e-commerce company, I watched our finance team spend hours daily on manual reconciliation. During our Series A fundraising, auditors found $50K in unmatched transactions. We spent weeks digging through spreadsheets and API logs. There had to be a better way."**

### Key Features

**API-First Design:**
- Everything accessible via REST API—no UI required (but one is provided)
- TypeScript SDK with full type safety
- Interactive playground for instant testing
- Comprehensive documentation and examples

**Real-Time Reconciliation:**
- Webhook-based event-driven architecture
- Automatic reconciliation as transactions occur
- Low latency (<100ms p95)
- Serverless infrastructure for global scale

**Composable Adapters:**
- Pluggable adapters for any platform
- Built-in adapters: Stripe, Shopify, QuickBooks, PayPal, Square, Xero, NetSuite
- Open-source adapter SDK for community contributions
- Custom adapters available for enterprise customers

**Compliance Built-In:**
- SOC 2 Type II ready (certification target: Q2 2026)
- GDPR, PCI-DSS Level 1 compliant
- Audit trails for compliance requirements
- White-label reports for enterprise

### How It Works

1. **Connect Platforms:** Configure adapters for Stripe, Shopify, QuickBooks, etc.
2. **Set Matching Rules:** Define how transactions should match (order ID, amount, timestamp)
3. **Automatic Reconciliation:** Runs in real-time or on schedule
4. **Get Reports & Alerts:** View matched transactions, unmatched alerts, and error handling

### Pricing

Settler offers transparent, usage-based pricing:

- **Free Tier:** 1,000 reconciliations/month, 2 adapters, community support
- **Starter:** $29/month (10K reconciliations)
- **Growth:** $99/month (100K reconciliations)
- **Scale:** $299/month (1M reconciliations)
- **Enterprise:** Custom pricing (unlimited)

**"We're following the Stripe playbook—dead-simple onboarding, pure API, usage-based pricing,"** said [Founder Name]. **"Developers can integrate Settler in 5 minutes, not weeks. That's the difference."**

### Early Traction

Settler launched a private beta in Q4 2024 with 50 developers from Twitter, Indie Hackers, and Product Hunt. The feedback was overwhelming:

- **"This is exactly what I needed."** — Shopify store owner
- **"Saved me 2 hours daily."** — SaaS founder
- **"Why didn't this exist before?"** — E-commerce CTO

**"The validation was clear—developers wanted this,"** said [Founder Name]. **"We're seeing strong product-market fit signals. Companies are upgrading from free to paid within 3-4 months, and our NPS is above 50."**

### Market Opportunity

The reconciliation software market is $2.3B (2024), growing 12% YoY. Settler targets 50K+ SMBs and mid-market companies with multi-platform operations—e-commerce stores, SaaS companies, fintech startups.

**"The market is ready,"** said [Founder Name]. **"API economy maturity, serverless infrastructure, developer-first movement—the timing is perfect. Every platform has APIs. The infrastructure exists. We just need to build the right abstraction."**

### Competitive Advantage

Settler differentiates from legacy solutions (BlackLine, QuickBooks) and data integration platforms (Fivetran) by focusing on:

- **Developer Experience:** 5-minute integration vs. weeks/months
- **Real-Time Processing:** Event-driven vs. batch processing
- **Composability:** Adapter SDK vs. closed systems
- **Pricing:** $29-$299/month vs. $100K+/year

**"We're not competing with BlackLine on features—we're competing on developer experience and speed,"** said [Founder Name]. **"Developers want APIs, not UIs. They want to integrate in minutes, not months. That's our moat."**

### Use Cases

**E-commerce Reconciliation:**
- Match Shopify orders with Stripe payments, PayPal refunds, shipping costs
- Real-time alerts on mismatches
- Automatic sync to QuickBooks

**SaaS Revenue Recognition:**
- Reconcile Stripe subscriptions with QuickBooks revenue

- Normalized data format

**Compliance Auditing:**
- Generate audit trails for SOC 2, PCI-DSS, financial audits

### Technology

- **Database:** PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Monitoring:** Grafana, Datadog
- **Compliance:** SOC 2, GDPR, PCI-DSS ready

**"We're cloud-native from day one,"** said [Founder Name]. **"Serverless infrastructure enables global scale at low cost. We can process millions of reconciliations without managing servers."**

### Funding

Settler is currently raising a $2M seed round to accelerate product development, expand its adapter library, and build its go-to-market engine.

**"We're looking for investors with fintech/SaaS experience, strategic partners in the Stripe/Shopify ecosystem, and operators who can help with GTM,"** said [Founder Name].
