**Version:** 2.0  
**Last Updated:** January 2026  
**Format:** SlideDoc (presentation + detailed notes)

## Slide 1: Title Slide

**Settler**  
*Reconciliation-as-a-Service*

**Making reconciliation as simple as sending an email**

---

**Speaker Notes:**
- Introduce yourself and Settler
- Set the stage: reconciliation is a $2.3B market, growing 12% YoY
- The problem: finance teams spend 2-3 hours daily on manual reconciliation
- The solution: API-first reconciliation service

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

### The Reconciliation Nightmare

Modern businesses operate across **10+ platforms**:

```
Stripe → Shopify → QuickBooks → NetSuite → Custom DBs → Webhooks
```

**The Cost:**
- 💸 **Revenue Leakage**: Unmatched transactions = lost revenue
- ⚖️ **Compliance Risks**: Manual reconciliation fails audits
- ⏰ **2-3 hours daily** spent on reconciliation
- 🔧 **Weeks of custom code** that breaks

**The Market:**
- $2.3B reconciliation software market (2024)
- Growing 12% YoY
- 50K+ SMBs and mid-market companies need this

---

**Speaker Notes:**
- Paint the picture: modern businesses use 10+ platforms
- Emphasize the pain: revenue leakage, compliance risks, wasted time
- Establish market size: $2.3B market, growing 12% YoY
- Target: 50K+ companies need this

---

## Slide 3: Why Existing Solutions Fail

| Solution | Why It Fails |
|----------|--------------|
| **QuickBooks/Xero** | Manual process, no real-time, limited API |
| **Stripe Revenue Recognition** | Stripe-only, no multi-platform |
| **Fivetran** | Not purpose-built for reconciliation, expensive |
| **Custom Scripts** | High maintenance, no compliance, brittle |
| **BlackLine** | Expensive ($100K+), complex, slow onboarding |

**The Gap:** No API-first, real-time, composable reconciliation service.

---

**Speaker Notes:**
- QuickBooks/Xero: Manual, not real-time, limited API
- Stripe: Single-platform, not multi-platform
- Fivetran: Not purpose-built, expensive, requires data warehouse
- Custom Scripts: High maintenance, no compliance, brittle
- BlackLine: Expensive ($100K+), complex, 6-month setup
- **The gap:** No API-first competitor exists

---

## Slide 4: Our Solution

### Reconciliation-as-a-Service (RaaS)

**One API. All Platforms. Real-Time.**

```typescript
npm install @settler/sdk

const client = new Settler({ apiKey: "sk_..." });

const job = await client.jobs.create({
  source: { adapter: "shopify", config: {...} },
  target: { adapter: "stripe", config: {...} },
  rules: { matching: [...] }
});

const report = await client.reports.get(job.id);
// ✅ 98.7% accuracy, 145 matched, 3 unmatched
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ API-first (no UI required)
- ✅ Real-time webhook reconciliation
- ✅ Composable adapters (Stripe, Shopify, QuickBooks, PayPal, +)
- ✅ Compliance built-in (SOC 2, GDPR, PCI-DSS)
- ✅ 5-minute integration

---

**Speaker Notes:**
- Show the code: simple, developer-friendly API
- Emphasize key features: API-first, real-time, composable, compliance
- Highlight speed: 5-minute integration vs. weeks/months
- Show results: 98.7% accuracy, real-time processing

---

## Slide 5: How It Works

```
┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
│   Shopify   │─────▶│   Settler    │─────▶│   Stripe    │
│   Orders    │      │    API      │      │  Payments   │
└─────────────┘      └─────────────┘      └─────────────┘
                            │
                            │ Reconciliation Engine
                            │ - Normalize data
                            │ - Match transactions
                            │ - Detect mismatches
                            │
                            ▼
                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │   Report    │
                    │ ✅ Matched: 145
                    │ ⚠️  Unmatched: 3
                    │ ❌ Errors: 1
                    └─────────────┘
```

**Process:**
1. Configure adapters (one-time setup)
2. Set matching rules
3. Automatic reconciliation (real-time or scheduled)
4. Get reports and alerts

---

**Speaker Notes:**
- Visualize the flow: platforms → Settler API → reconciliation engine → reports
- Emphasize simplicity: configure once, run automatically
- Show value: matched transactions, unmatched alerts, error handling
