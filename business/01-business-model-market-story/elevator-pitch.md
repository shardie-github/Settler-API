# Settler: Elevator Pitch

## One-Liner

**Settler automates financial reconciliation across Stripe, Shopify, QuickBooks, and 50+ platforms—eliminating hours of manual work with a 5-minute API integration.**

## Two-Liner

**Settler is reconciliation-as-a-service for modern businesses. We eliminate the expensive pain of manually matching transactions across fragmented SaaS platforms—reducing reconciliation time from hours to minutes, preventing revenue leakage, and ensuring compliance—all through a single API.**

## Problem Statement (30 seconds)

Modern businesses operate across 10+ platforms: Stripe for payments, Shopify for orders, QuickBooks for accounting, NetSuite for ERP. Each platform has its own data format, timing, and quirks. Finance teams spend 2-3 hours daily manually reconciling transactions, hunting for mismatches, and fixing errors. This causes:

- **Revenue Leakage**: Unmatched transactions = lost revenue
- **Compliance Risks**: Manual reconciliation fails audits
- **Operational Overhead**: Hours wasted on repetitive work
- **Developer Friction**: Weeks of custom reconciliation code that breaks

**The Market**: $2.3B reconciliation software market, growing 12% YoY. 50K+ SMBs and mid-market companies need this.
