## Executive Summary

Settler operates in a fragmented reconciliation market spanning enterprise software, accounting platforms, payment processors, and data integration tools. Our analysis of 12+ competitors reveals a clear white space: **no API-first, real-time, composable reconciliation service** targeting developers and modern businesses.

**Key Finding:** The market is divided between expensive enterprise solutions (BlackLine, Trintech) requiring months of implementation, and manual processes (QuickBooks, Excel) that don't scale. Settler bridges this gap with developer-first automation.
