# Founder Story: Why Settler? Why Now?

## The Problem I Lived

Three years ago, I was the CTO of a fast-growing e-commerce company. We were processing thousands of orders daily across Shopify, Stripe, PayPal, and QuickBooks. Every morning, our finance team spent 2-3 hours manually reconciling transactions—matching Shopify orders with Stripe payments, tracking refunds, hunting for mismatches.

**The breaking point:** During our Series A fundraising, our auditors found $50K in unmatched transactions. We spent weeks digging through spreadsheets, API logs, and webhook payloads. We eventually found the issue—a timing mismatch between Shopify order creation and Stripe payment capture. But the damage was done: delayed fundraising, frustrated investors, and a finance team burned out.

**I thought:** "There has to be a better way."

## The Existing Solutions Failed Me

I evaluated every option:

1. **QuickBooks/Xero**: Manual process, no real-time, limited API. Still required hours of manual work.

2. **Stripe Revenue Recognition**: Stripe-only. We used PayPal, Square, and Apple Pay too.

3. **Fivetran**: Not purpose-built for reconciliation. Expensive ($500+/month), complex setup, required a data warehouse.

4. **BlackLine**: Enterprise-grade, but $100K+/year and 6-month implementation. Way too expensive and slow for us.

5. **Custom Scripts**: I built a Python script. It worked for a month, then broke when Stripe changed their API. Maintenance nightmare.

**The gap:** No API-first, real-time, composable reconciliation service targeting developers and modern businesses.

## The "Why Now" Moment

Three trends converged:

### 1. API Economy Maturity
Every platform now has APIs and webhooks. Stripe, Shopify, QuickBooks, NetSuite—they all expose their data programmatically. The infrastructure exists to build reconciliation-as-a-service.

### 2. Serverless Infrastructure
Lambda, Vercel, Cloudflare Workers enable global scale at low cost. We can process millions of reconciliations without managing servers.

### 3. Developer-First Tools Success
Stripe, Resend, Supabase proved that API-first SaaS works. Developers want simple APIs, not complex UIs. They want to integrate in minutes, not months.

**The insight:** If Stripe can make payments as simple as `stripe.charges.create()`, why can't reconciliation be as simple as `settler.reconcile()`?

## Building Settler

I left my CTO role in Q3 2024 and started building Settler. The vision: **reconciliation-as-a-service**—a single API that normalizes, validates, and reconciles data across all platforms in real-time.

### Core Principles

1. **API-First**: Everything accessible via REST API. No UI required (but we provide one).

2. **Composable**: Pluggable adapters for any platform. Open-source adapter SDK.

3. **Developer Experience**: `npm install @settler/sdk` → instant playground → production-ready.

4. **Transparency**: Every operation logged, queryable, and auditable.

5. **Compliance by Default**: GDPR, PCI-DSS Level 1, SOC 2 Type II ready out of the box.

### The MVP (Months 1-3)

I built the core reconciliation engine, Stripe and Shopify adapters, and a TypeScript SDK. I launched a private beta with 50 developers from Twitter, Indie Hackers, and Product Hunt. The feedback was overwhelming:

- **"This is exactly what I needed."** — Shopify store owner
- **"Saved me 2 hours daily."** — SaaS founder
- **"Why didn't this exist before?"** — E-commerce CTO

**The validation:** Product-market fit signals were strong. Developers wanted this.

## Why Now? The Market Timing

### 1. E-commerce Growth
Multi-platform operations are standard, not exception. Every e-commerce company uses Stripe + Shopify + QuickBooks. The market is large and growing.

### 2. Compliance Requirements
GDPR, SOC 2, PCI-DSS are table stakes for SaaS. Companies need audit trails and compliance guarantees. Manual reconciliation fails audits.

### 3. Developer-First Movement
Developers are the new buyers. They want APIs, not UIs. They want to integrate in minutes, not months. They want transparency and control.

### 4. API Economy Maturity
Every platform has APIs. The infrastructure exists. The timing is perfect.

### 5. Competitive Window
No API-first competitor exists. BlackLine is expensive and slow. QuickBooks is manual. Stripe is single-platform. Fivetran is not purpose-built. **The window is open.**

---

## The Vision

**Year 1:** 1,000 customers, $600K ARR, SOC 2 Type II certified  
**Year 2:** 5,000 customers, $2.4M ARR, 50+ adapters  
**Year 3:** 20,000 customers, $12M ARR, market leader

**Beyond Reconciliation:**
- Revenue recognition automation
- Tax calculation and filing
- Multi-entity consolidation
- Financial reporting automation

**The mission:** Make reconciliation as simple as sending an email.

## Why I'm Building This

### 1. I Lived the Pain
I spent hours daily on manual reconciliation. I built custom scripts that broke. I failed audits. I know the problem intimately.

### 2. The Market is Ready
API economy maturity, serverless infrastructure, developer-first movement—the timing is perfect.

### 3. The Technology Exists
APIs, webhooks, serverless infrastructure—everything we need exists. We just need to build the right abstraction.

### 4. The Competitive Window is Open
No API-first competitor exists. The window is open, but it won't stay open forever.

### 5. I Can Build This
10+ years building developer tools and APIs. Deep understanding of financial operations and compliance. Strong network in fintech, e-commerce, and developer communities.
