## Testing Tools

### Recommended Tools
1. **OWASP ZAP** - Web application security scanner
2. **Burp Suite** - Web vulnerability scanner
3. **Nmap** - Network exploration and security auditing
4. **SQLMap** - Automated SQL injection tool
5. **Nikto** - Web server scanner
6. **MobSF** - Mobile Security Framework (for mobile app testing)

### Automated Scanning
- [ ] Run OWASP ZAP baseline scan
- [ ] Run Burp Suite active scan
- [ ] Run dependency vulnerability scan
- [ ] Run container security scan

## Test Environment

### Requirements
- [ ] Test environment isolated from production
- [ ] Test data prepared (no production data)
- [ ] Monitoring and logging enabled
- [ ] Backup and rollback plan ready

### Test Accounts
- [ ] Admin account created
- [ ] Regular user account created
- [ ] Test API keys generated
- [ ] Test webhooks configured

## Reporting

### Deliverables
- [ ] Executive summary
- [ ] Detailed findings report
- [ ] Risk assessment
- [ ] Remediation recommendations
- [ ] Proof of concept (if applicable)

### Report Format
1. **Executive Summary**
