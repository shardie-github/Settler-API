1. Check existing issues and pull requests
2. Join our Discord: [discord.gg/settler](https://discord.gg/settler)
3. Read this contributing guide
4. Set up your development environment

**Good first issues:**
- Look for issues labeled `good-first-issue`
- Check our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/settler/settler/issues)

---

### Development Environment Setup

#### Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** 18+ (check with `node --version`)
- **npm:** 9+ (check with `npm --version`)
- **PostgreSQL:** 14+ (or use Docker)
- **Redis:** 7+ (or use Docker)
- **Docker:** Optional but recommended
- **Git:** Latest version

#### Step 1: Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/settler/settler.git
cd settler
```

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install root dependencies
npm install

# Install workspace dependencies
npm run install:all
```

#### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

```bash
# Copy example env file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your configuration
# Required variables:
# - DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD
# - REDIS_HOST, REDIS_PORT
# - JWT_SECRET, JWT_REFRESH_SECRET, ENCRYPTION_KEY
```

#### Step 4: Start Infrastructure

```bash
# Using Docker Compose (recommended)
cd packages/api
docker-compose up -d

# Or start manually:
# - PostgreSQL on port 5432
# - Redis on port 6379
```

#### Step 5: Run Migrations

```bash
cd packages/api
npm run migrate

# Or manually:
psql -U postgres -d settler -f src/db/migrations/001-initial-schema.sql
```

#### Step 6: Start Development Server

```bash
# API server
cd packages/api
npm run dev

# Web UI (optional)
cd packages/web
npm run dev

# SDK (for testing)
cd packages/sdk
npm run build
```

**Verify setup:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
# Should return: {"status":"healthy","database":"connected","redis":"connected"}
```

### Making Changes

#### Branch Naming

- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring
- `test/description` - Test additions/updates

**Examples:**
- `feature/add-paypal-adapter`
- `fix/webhook-retry-logic`
- `docs/update-api-docs`

#### Code Style

**TypeScript:**
- Use TypeScript strict mode

- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Functions/Variables: `camelCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

**Example:**
```typescript
// Good
export class ReconciliationService {
  private readonly apiKey: string;
  
  async createJob(config: JobConfig): Promise<Job> {
    // ...
  }
}

// Bad
export class reconciliation_service {
  private readonly api_key: string;
  
  async create_job(config: job_config): Promise<job> {
    // ...
  }
}
```

```

#### Writing Tests

**Unit Tests:**
```typescript
// __tests__/services/JobService.test.ts
import { JobService } from '../services/JobService';

describe('JobService', () => {
  it('should create a job', async () => {
    const service = new JobService();
    const job = await service.create({ name: 'Test Job' });
    expect(job.name).toBe('Test Job');
  });
});
```

**Integration Tests:**
```typescript
// __tests__/integration/jobs.test.ts
import request from 'supertest';
import app from '../../src/index';

describe('POST /api/v1/jobs', () => {
  it('should create a job', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/v1/jobs')
      .set('X-API-Key', 'test-key')
      .send({ name: 'Test Job' });
    
    expect(response.status).toBe(201);
    expect(response.body.data.name).toBe('Test Job');
  });
});
```

**Test Coverage:**
- Aim for 80%+ coverage
- Critical paths should have 100% coverage
- Use `npm run test:coverage` to check
