## Introduction

Reconciliation is the process of matching transactions between different systems to ensure accuracy and completeness. This guide covers best practices for modern finance teams.

---

## Why Reconciliation Matters

### 1. Accuracy
- Ensures financial records are correct
- Prevents revenue leakage
- Catches errors early

### 2. Compliance
- Required for audits
- Regulatory compliance (SOC 2, PCI-DSS)
- Financial reporting accuracy

### 3. Efficiency
- Reduces manual work
- Faster month-end close
- Real-time visibility

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Automate Everything

**Manual reconciliation doesn't scale.**

- Use APIs to fetch data automatically
- Set up scheduled reconciliations
- Real-time matching via webhooks

**Example:**
```typescript
// Daily reconciliation at 2 AM
const job = await settler.jobs.create({
  name: "Daily Reconciliation",
  schedule: "0 2 * * *",
  // ...
});
```

### 2. Match on Multiple Fields

**Don't rely on a single field.**

- Match on transaction ID + amount + date
- Use tolerance for amounts (e.g., $0.01)
- Consider date ranges (transactions may arrive at different times)

**Example:**
```typescript
rules: {
  matching: [
    { field: "transaction_id", type: "exact" },
    { field: "amount", type: "exact", tolerance: 0.01 },
    { field: "date", type: "range", days: 1 },
  ],
}
```

### 3. Handle Exceptions Systematically

**Not everything will match automatically.**

- Review exceptions daily
- Categorize by reason (amount mismatch, missing transaction, etc.)
- Resolve in bulk when possible
- Document resolutions for audit

**Example:**
```typescript
// Get exceptions
const exceptions = await settler.exceptions.list({
  resolution_status: "open",
});

// Bulk resolve low-severity exceptions
await settler.exceptions.bulkResolve({
  exceptionIds: exceptions.data.filter(e => e.severity === "low").map(e => e.id),
  resolution: "ignored",
  notes: "Low-value transactions, acceptable variance",
});
```

### 4. Use Confidence Scores

**Not all matches are equal.**

- High confidence (0.95+): Auto-approve
- Medium confidence (0.80-0.95): Review
- Low confidence (<0.80): Manual review required

### 5. Maintain Audit Trails

**Compliance requires complete records.**

- Log all reconciliation decisions
- Track who resolved exceptions
- Keep historical data (7+ years for some industries)

### 6. Monitor Accuracy

**Track reconciliation metrics.**

- Match rate (target: 95%+)
- Exception rate (target: <5%)
- Resolution time (target: <24h)

**Example:**
```typescript
// Get usage dashboard
const usage = await settler.dashboards.usage({
  startDate: "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  endDate: "2026-01-31T23:59:59Z",
});

console.log("Accuracy:", usage.data.accuracyTrends);
console.log("Exception rate:", usage.data.exceptionRate);
```

### 7. Handle Multi-Currency

**FX conversion is complex.**

- Use reliable rate sources (ECB, OANDA)
- Convert to base currency consistently
- Track conversion rates for audit

**Example:**
```typescript
rules: {
  fxConversion: {
    enabled: true,
    baseCurrency: "USD",
    rateDate: "transaction", // Use rate from transaction date
  },
}
```

### 8. Set Up Alerts

**Know when things go wrong.**

- Alert on accuracy drops (<95%)
- Alert on high exception rates (>10%)
- Alert on reconciliation failures

**Example:**
```typescript
await settler.alerts.rules.create({
  name: "Low Accuracy Alert",
  metric: "reconciliation.accuracy",
  threshold: 95,
  operator: "lt",
  channels: ["email", "slack"],
});
```

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Too Strict Matching Rules

**Problem:** High exception rate, low match rate

**Solution:** Use tolerance for amounts, date ranges for dates

### 2. Ignoring Exceptions

**Problem:** Exceptions pile up, accuracy suffers

**Solution:** Review exceptions daily, resolve systematically

### 3. No Audit Trail

**Problem:** Can't prove compliance

**Solution:** Log all decisions, track who resolved what

### 4. Manual Reconciliation

**Problem:** Doesn't scale, error-prone

**Solution:** Automate with APIs, use reconciliation tools
