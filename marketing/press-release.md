## Settler Launches Reconciliation-as-a-Service API, Eliminates Manual Payment Reconciliation

**Developer-first API automates reconciliation across Stripe, Shopify, QuickBooks, and 50+ platforms**

**SAN FRANCISCO, CA — January 15, 2026** — Settler, a reconciliation-as-a-service platform, today announced the launch of its API that automates payment reconciliation across fragmented SaaS and e-commerce ecosystems. The platform eliminates hours of manual spreadsheet work with a 5-minute API integration.

Settler solves the problem of multi-platform reconciliation—matching transactions between Stripe payments, Shopify orders, QuickBooks accounting, and other systems. Finance teams currently spend 2-3 hours daily manually reconciling transactions, leading to errors, revenue leakage, and compliance risks.

"Every business that processes payments needs reconciliation, but manual processes don't scale," said Scott Hardie, founder and CEO of Settler. "We built Settler to be the 'Resend for reconciliation'—dead-simple onboarding, pure API, usage-based pricing, and composable adapters for every platform."
