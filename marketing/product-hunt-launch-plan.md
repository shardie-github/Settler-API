## Product Hunt Post Content

### Title
**Settler - Reconciliation-as-a-Service API**

### Tagline
**Automate payment reconciliation across Stripe, Shopify, QuickBooks, and 50+ platforms**

### Description

Settler is reconciliation-as-a-Service—a single API that automates payment reconciliation across fragmented SaaS and e-commerce ecosystems.

**The Problem:**
Modern businesses operate across 10+ platforms: Stripe for payments, Shopify for orders, QuickBooks for accounting. Finance teams spend 2-3 hours daily manually reconciling transactions in spreadsheets. This causes:
- Revenue leakage from unmatched transactions
- Compliance risks (manual reconciliation fails audits)
- Operational overhead (hours wasted on repetitive work)

**The Solution:**
Settler automates reconciliation with a 5-minute API integration:
1. Connect your platforms (Stripe, Shopify, QuickBooks, etc.)
2. Configure matching rules (order ID, amount, timestamp)
3. Automatic reconciliation runs in real-time or on schedule
4. Review exceptions in the exception queue
5. Export to accounting or sync directly

**Key Features:**
- ⚡ 5-minute integration (not 5 days)
- 🔄 Real-time reconciliation (not batch)
- 🔌 Composable adapters (Stripe, Shopify, PayPal, QuickBooks, Square, 50+ more)
- 🔒 Compliance-ready (SOC 2, GDPR, PCI-DSS)
- 📊 Complete audit trail
- 🌍 Multi-currency support

**Pricing:**
- Free: 1,000 reconciliations/month
- Starter: $29/month (10,000/month)
- Growth: $99/month (100,000/month)
- Scale: $299/month (1,000,000/month)

**Try It:**
```bash
npm install @settler/sdk
```

```typescript
import Settler from "@settler/sdk";

const settler = new Settler({ apiKey: "sk_test_..." });

const job = await settler.jobs.create({
  name: "Shopify-Stripe Reconciliation",
  source: { adapter: "shopify", config: { apiKey: "..." } },
  target: { adapter: "stripe", config: { apiKey: "..." } },
  rules: { matching: [
    { field: "order_id", type: "exact" },
    { field: "amount", type: "exact", tolerance: 0.01 }
  ]}
});

await settler.jobs.run(job.data.id);
const report = await settler.reports.get(job.data.id);
console.log(`Matched: ${report.data.summary.matched}`);
```
