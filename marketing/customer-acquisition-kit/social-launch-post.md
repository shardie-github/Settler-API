**Title:** Settler — Reconciliation-as-a-Service API (RaaS) | Automate financial data reconciliation across platforms

**Tagline:** Make reconciliation as simple as sending an email. API-first, developer-friendly, compliance-ready.

**Description:**

🚀 **Settler is live!** We're making financial reconciliation as simple as sending an email.

**The Problem:**
Your business runs on 10+ platforms (Stripe, Shopify, QuickBooks, PayPal, etc.). Manual reconciliation takes hours daily, causes revenue leakage, and fails compliance audits. Custom scripts break. Excel is error-prone.

**The Solution:**
Settler is a **Reconciliation-as-a-Service API** that automates cross-platform data validation in real-time. Think "Resend for reconciliation"—dead-simple onboarding, pure API, usage-based pricing.

**Why Settler?**
✅ **5-minute integration** — `npm install @settler/sdk` → production-ready  
✅ **Real-time webhooks** — Instant reconciliation as events happen  
✅ **Composable adapters** — Stripe, Shopify, QuickBooks, PayPal, Square, and more  
✅ **Compliance-ready** — GDPR, SOC 2 Type II, PCI-DSS Level 1 built-in  
✅ **Developer-first** — TypeScript SDK, web playground, full observability  
✅ **Free tier** — 1,000 reconciliations/month to get started

**Perfect for:**
- E-commerce stores reconciling orders and payments
- SaaS companies with multi-platform revenue streams
- Finance teams automating daily reconciliation
- Developers who hate manual reconciliation

## Twitter/X Launch Thread

**Thread 1: The Hook**

🧵 Introducing **Settler** — Reconciliation-as-a-Service API

Stop spending hours manually reconciling data across Stripe, Shopify, QuickBooks, and 10+ other platforms.

We built an API that does it automatically. In real-time. With compliance built-in.

Here's why it matters 👇

---

**Thread 2: The Problem**

The problem: Modern businesses run on fragmented platforms.

• Stripe for payments
• Shopify for orders  
• QuickBooks for accounting
• PayPal, Square, NetSuite...

Manual reconciliation = revenue leakage + compliance risks + wasted time

Finance teams spend 2-3 hours daily on this. It shouldn't be this hard.

---

**Thread 3: The Solution**

Settler is Reconciliation-as-a-Service (RaaS).

One API that:
✅ Normalizes data across platforms
✅ Matches transactions automatically
✅ Alerts on mismatches in real-time
✅ Generates compliance-ready reports

Think "Resend for reconciliation" — API-first, developer-friendly, dead-simple.

---

**Thread 4: Developer Experience**

For developers:

```typescript
import Settler from "@settler/sdk";

const settler = new Settler({ apiKey: "sk_..." });

const job = await settler.jobs.create({
  source: { adapter: "shopify", ... },
  target: { adapter: "stripe", ... },
  rules: { matching: [...] }
});

const report = await settler.reports.get(job.id);
```

5 minutes to production. No custom reconciliation logic needed.

---

**Thread 5: Key Features**

What makes Settler different:

🔌 **Composable adapters** — Stripe, Shopify, QuickBooks, PayPal, Square, NetSuite, Xero, and more

⚡ **Real-time webhooks** — Reconcile as events happen, not in batches

🛡️ **Compliance-ready** — GDPR, SOC 2 Type II, PCI-DSS Level 1 built-in

📊 **Full observability** — Every operation logged, queryable, auditable

🎯 **Smart matching** — Exact, fuzzy, range, and custom JavaScript rules

---

**Thread 6: Use Cases**

Perfect for:

• E-commerce stores → Reconcile Shopify orders with Stripe payments
• SaaS companies → Multi-platform revenue reconciliation
• Finance teams → Automated daily reconciliation reports
• Developers → No more brittle custom reconciliation scripts

---

**Thread 7: Pricing & Free Tier**

Pricing that scales with you:

🆓 **Free tier:** 1,000 reconciliations/month  
💰 **Starter:** $29/month (10K reconciliations)  
📈 **Growth:** $99/month (100K reconciliations)  
🚀 **Scale:** $299/month (1M reconciliations)

Usage-based pricing. No surprises. Start free.
