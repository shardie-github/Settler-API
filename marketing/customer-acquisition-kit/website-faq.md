# Frequently Asked Questions

**Everything you need to know about Settler.**

---

## General

### What is Settler?

Settler is **Reconciliation-as-a-Service**—an API that automatically matches and reconciles transactions across Stripe, Shopify, QuickBooks, PayPal, and 15+ other platforms. Think "Resend for reconciliation"—dead-simple onboarding, pure API, usage-based pricing.

### Who is Settler for?

**Developers** who want to automate reconciliation without building custom infrastructure.

**Finance teams** who spend hours daily on manual reconciliation.

**CTOs** who want to reduce operational overhead and focus engineering time on core product.

**E-commerce businesses** processing payments across multiple platforms.

**SaaS companies** syncing payment data with accounting systems.

### How is Settler different from QuickBooks/Xero reconciliation?

QuickBooks and Xero have **manual** reconciliation features. Settler is **fully automated** via API:

- ✅ Real-time webhook reconciliation (no manual steps)
- ✅ Multi-platform reconciliation (not just accounting systems)
- ✅ Programmatic access (integrate into your workflows)
- ✅ Smart matching rules (fuzzy matching, custom logic)
- ✅ Developer-friendly (TypeScript SDK, full API)

### Do I need to be a developer to use Settler?

**For production use:** Yes, you'll need a developer to integrate the SDK (takes ~5 minutes).

**For testing:** No! Try our [Playground](https://settler.io/playground) to test integrations visually without code.

## Technical

### What programming languages do you support?

**TypeScript/JavaScript** (Node.js, Bun) — Full SDK support

**Python** — SDK coming Q2 2026

**Ruby** — SDK coming Q2 2026

**Go** — SDK coming Q3 2026

**REST API** — Works with any language

### How does reconciliation work?

1. **Fetch data** from source platform (e.g., Shopify orders)
2. **Fetch data** from target platform (e.g., Stripe payments)
3. **Normalize** data to common format
4. **Match** transactions using rules (order ID, amount, date, etc.)
5. **Generate report** with matched/unmatched transactions
6. **Alert** on mismatches (via webhook or email)

### What matching rules are available?

- **Exact match** — Field values must match exactly
- **Fuzzy match** — Similarity-based matching (e.g., customer names)
- **Range match** — Date/amount within tolerance
- **Custom function** — JavaScript-based custom logic

[View matching rules docs →](https://docs.settler.io/matching-rules)

### How do webhooks work?

Settler receives webhooks from your platforms (Stripe, Shopify, etc.) and automatically triggers reconciliation when new events arrive.

You can also receive webhooks from Settler when reconciliation completes or mismatches occur.

[View webhook docs →](https://docs.settler.io/webhooks)

### What happens if reconciliation fails?

**Automatic retries:** Exponential backoff (3 attempts)

**Error handling:** Failed transactions logged with error details

**Alerts:** Webhook/email notification on persistent failures

**Dead letter queue:** Failed transactions queued for manual review

### How accurate is reconciliation?

**Typical accuracy:** 95-99% (depends on data quality and matching rules)

**Improving accuracy:**
- Fine-tune matching rules
- Use fuzzy matching for edge cases
- Add custom matching logic
- Review unmatched transactions regularly

### Can I customize reconciliation logic?

**Yes!** Custom JavaScript functions for matching:

```typescript
rules: {
  matching: [
    {
      field: "custom",
      type: "function",
      fn: "(source, target) => source.metadata.orderId === target.metadata.ref",
    },
  ],
}
```
