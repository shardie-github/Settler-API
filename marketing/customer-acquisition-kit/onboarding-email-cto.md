# Welcome to Settler — Reconciliation Infrastructure, Solved

**Subject:** {{cto_name}}, your team can now automate reconciliation in days, not months

---

Hi {{cto_name}},

Thanks for signing up for Settler. I wanted to reach out personally because I know what it's like to balance building core product features with operational infrastructure—especially when it comes to financial reconciliation.

## The Problem You're Solving

Your finance team spends **2-3 hours daily** on manual reconciliation. Your engineers spend **weeks** building custom reconciliation logic that breaks when APIs change. You're dealing with:

- Revenue leakage from unmatched transactions
- Compliance risks from manual processes
- Engineering time diverted from core product work
- Scaling challenges as you add more platforms

**Settler solves this.** Your team integrates once, and reconciliation runs automatically—with real-time alerts, audit trails, and compliance built-in.

## What Your Team Gets

### For Your Engineers

- **5-minute integration** vs. weeks of custom code
- **TypeScript SDK** with full type safety
- **15+ built-in adapters** (Stripe, Shopify, QuickBooks, PayPal, etc.)
- **Real-time webhooks** for instant reconciliation
- **Self-service configuration** — no more engineering tickets for finance

### For Your Finance Team

- **Automated daily reconciliation** — runs on schedule
- **Exception handling** — only see what needs attention
- **Compliance-ready reports** — audit trails built-in
- **Multi-currency support** — handles global operations
- **White-label reports** — share with stakeholders

### For Your Business

- **Reduce reconciliation time by 80%** — from hours to minutes
- **Eliminate manual errors** — automated matching with smart rules
- **Scale without hiring** — handles millions of transactions
- **SOC 2 Type II ready** — compliance built-in from day one

## Quick Start for Your Team

**Week 1: Proof of Concept**
- Your engineer sets up one reconciliation job (5 minutes)
- Test with your most critical platform pair (e.g., Shopify ↔ Stripe)
- Review first reports and validate accuracy

**Week 2: Production Rollout**
- Add remaining platforms
- Configure scheduled jobs for daily reconciliation
- Set up webhook alerts for mismatches

**Week 3: Optimization**
- Fine-tune matching rules based on real data
- Train finance team on exception handling
- Document processes for your team

**Total Engineering Time: ~2-4 hours** (vs. 2-3 weeks building custom solution)

## ROI Calculator

**Current State:**
- Finance team: 2-3 hours/day × $50/hour = **$2,500-3,750/month**
- Engineering time: 2-3 weeks/year × $100/hour = **$8,000-12,000/year**
- Revenue leakage: ~0.1% of transactions = **$X,XXX/month** (varies)

**With Settler:**
- Finance team: 15 minutes/day × $50/hour = **$375/month** (85% reduction)
