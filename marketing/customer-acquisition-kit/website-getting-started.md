# Getting Started with Settler

**Automate financial reconciliation across all your platforms in 5 minutes.**

---

## What is Settler?

Settler is **Reconciliation-as-a-Service**—an API that automatically matches and reconciles transactions across Stripe, Shopify, QuickBooks, PayPal, and 15+ other platforms. Think "Resend for reconciliation"—dead-simple onboarding, pure API, usage-based pricing.

**The Problem:** Modern businesses operate across 10+ platforms. Data inconsistencies cause revenue leakage, compliance risks, and hours of manual work.

**The Solution:** Settler normalizes, validates, and reconciles data across all sources in real-time—with instant alerts, audit trails, and compliance built-in.

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Sign Up

[Create your free account →](https://settler.io/signup)

No credit card required. Get 1,000 reconciliations/month free forever.

### Step 2: Install the SDK

```bash
npm install @settler/sdk
```

### Step 3: Get Your API Key

1. Go to [Dashboard → API Keys](https://settler.io/dashboard/api-keys)
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Copy your key (starts with `sk_`)

**⚠️ Keep your API key secret.** Never commit it to git. Use environment variables.

### Step 4: Create Your First Reconciliation Job

```typescript
import Settler from "@settler/sdk";

const settler = new Settler({
  apiKey: process.env.SETTLER_API_KEY,
});

// Create a reconciliation job
const job = await settler.jobs.create({
  name: "Shopify-Stripe Reconciliation",
  source: {
    adapter: "shopify",
    config: {
      apiKey: process.env.SHOPIFY_API_KEY,
      shopDomain: "your-shop.myshopify.com",
    },
  },
  target: {
    adapter: "stripe",
    config: {
      apiKey: process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY,
    },
  },
  rules: {
    matching: [
      { field: "order_id", type: "exact" },
      { field: "amount", type: "exact", tolerance: 0.01 },
    ],
    conflictResolution: "last-wins",
  },
  schedule: "0 2 * * *", // Daily at 2 AM UTC
});

console.log(`Job created: ${job.data.id}`);
```

### Step 5: Get Results

```typescript
// Fetch reconciliation report
const report = await settler.reports.get(job.data.id, {
  startDate: "2026-01-01",
  endDate: "2026-01-31",
});

console.log(report.data.summary);
// {
//   matched: 145,
//   unmatched: 3,
//   errors: 1,
//   accuracy: 98.7,
//   totalTransactions: 149
// }
```

**That's it!** Your reconciliation is now running automatically.

## Common Use Cases

### E-commerce Order Reconciliation

**Problem:** Shopify orders don't match Stripe payments. Manual reconciliation takes hours.

**Solution:** Automate matching by order ID and amount. Get alerts on mismatches.

```typescript
const job = await settler.jobs.create({
  name: "Order Payment Reconciliation",
  source: { adapter: "shopify", config: { /* ... */ } },
  target: { adapter: "stripe", config: { /* ... */ } },
  rules: {
    matching: [
      { field: "order_id", type: "exact" },
      { field: "amount", type: "exact", tolerance: 0.01 },
    ],
  },
});
```

### Multi-Platform Payment Reconciliation

**Problem:** Payments come from Stripe, PayPal, and Square. Need unified reconciliation.

**Solution:** Reconcile all payment sources against QuickBooks automatically.

```typescript
const job = await settler.jobs.create({
  name: "Multi-Payment Reconciliation",
  sources: [
    { adapter: "stripe", config: { /* ... */ } },
    { adapter: "paypal", config: { /* ... */ } },
    { adapter: "square", config: { /* ... */ } },
  ],
  target: { adapter: "quickbooks", config: { /* ... */ } },
  rules: {
    matching: [
      { field: "transaction_id", type: "fuzzy", threshold: 0.8 },
      { field: "amount", type: "exact" },
    ],
  },
});
```

### Accounting System Sync

**Problem:** QuickBooks is out of sync with payment processors. Manual sync is error-prone.

**Solution:** Automated daily sync with exception handling.

```typescript
const job = await settler.jobs.create({
  name: "Payment to Accounting Sync",
  source: { adapter: "stripe", config: { /* ... */ } },
  target: { adapter: "quickbooks", config: { /* ... */ } },
  rules: {
    matching: [
      { field: "invoice_id", type: "exact" },
      { field: "amount", type: "exact" },
      { field: "date", type: "range", days: 2 },
    ],
    conflictResolution: "manual-review",
  },
  schedule: "0 2 * * *", // Daily at 2 AM
});
```
