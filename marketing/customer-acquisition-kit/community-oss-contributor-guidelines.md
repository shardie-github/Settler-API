# Community & Open Source Contributor Guidelines

Welcome to the Settler community! 🎉 We're thrilled you're interested in contributing. This guide will help you understand our open source strategy, how to contribute, and what makes our community special.

---

## Our Open Source Philosophy

### What's Open Source?

**MIT Licensed (Free & Open):**
- ✅ **Core SDK** (`@settler/sdk`) — TypeScript SDK for integrating with Settler
- ✅ **Adapter SDK** (`@settler/adapter-sdk`) — Build your own adapters
- ✅ **Community Adapters** — Individual platform adapters
- ✅ **Documentation** — Full docs (CC BY 4.0)
- ✅ **Self-Hosted Core** — Core reconciliation engine (AGPL v3)

**Proprietary (Hosted Service):**
- 🔒 **Hosted Service** — Managed infrastructure, scaling, SLA
- 🔒 **Enterprise Features** — SSO, dedicated infrastructure, custom SLAs
- 🔒 **Advanced Analytics** — ML-powered insights, predictive alerts
- 🔒 **Compliance Certifications** — SOC 2, PCI-DSS (hosted only)

### Why This Model?

We believe in:
- **Developer Freedom** — Self-host if you want full control
- **Sustainable Business** — Hosted service funds development
- **Community Growth** — Open source enables contributions and adoption
- **Best of Both Worlds** — Open core + managed service

- 📚 **Documentation** — Improve docs, add examples, fix typos
- 🧪 **Tests** — Add test coverage, improve test quality
- 🎨 **UI/UX** — Improve web dashboard, playground, or CLI

**Getting Started:**
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/settler.git`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`

### 2. Adapter Contributions

**Building a New Adapter:**

Adapters are the heart of Settler. They connect Settler to external platforms (Stripe, Shopify, QuickBooks, etc.).

**Step 1: Create Adapter Class**

```typescript
// packages/adapters/src/your-platform.ts
import { Adapter, NormalizedData, FetchOptions } from "@settler/adapter-sdk";

export class YourPlatformAdapter implements Adapter {
  name = "your-platform";
  version = "1.0.0";

  async fetch(options: FetchOptions): Promise<NormalizedData[]> {
    // Fetch data from your platform's API
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.your-platform.com/data`, {
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${options.config.apiKey}` }
    });
    const data = await response.json();
    return data.map(item => this.normalize(item));
  }

  normalize(rawData: any): NormalizedData {
    return {
      id: rawData.id,
      amount: rawData.amount,
      currency: rawData.currency,
      date: new Date(rawData.created_at),
      metadata: rawData.metadata
    };
  }

  validate(data: NormalizedData): ValidationResult {
    // Validate normalized data
    if (!data.id || !data.amount) {
      return { valid: false, errors: ["Missing required fields"] };
    }
    return { valid: true };
  }
}
```

**Step 2: Register Adapter**

```typescript
// packages/adapters/src/index.ts
export { YourPlatformAdapter } from "./your-platform";
```

**Step 3: Add Tests**

```typescript
// packages/adapters/src/__tests__/your-platform.test.ts
import { YourPlatformAdapter } from "../your-platform";

describe("YourPlatformAdapter", () => {
  it("should fetch data", async () => {
    const adapter = new YourPlatformAdapter();
    const data = await adapter.fetch({ config: { apiKey: "test" } });
    expect(data).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```

**Step 4: Update Documentation**

Add your adapter to:
- `docs/adapters.md` — Adapter documentation
- `packages/adapters/README.md` — Adapter list

**Step 5: Submit PR**

Create a pull request with:
- Adapter implementation
- Tests
- Documentation
- Example usage

**Adapter Requirements:**
- ✅ Implement `Adapter` interface from `@settler/adapter-sdk`
- ✅ Normalize data to Settler's standard format
- ✅ Handle errors gracefully
- ✅ Include tests (80%+ coverage)
- ✅ Document configuration options
- ✅ Follow naming conventions (`platform-name`)

**Popular Adapters to Build:**
- WooCommerce
- BigCommerce
- Magento
- Salesforce
- HubSpot
- Zoho
- Sage
- Xero
- NetSuite
- SAP
