# Settler Developer Customer Blueprint
## Developer-First Personas, Value Props, and GTM Strategy

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Status:** Strategic Blueprint  
**Author:** Product Strategy Team

---

## Task A – Settler Context Snapshot

**Product:** Settler is an API-first, infrastructure-native payment reconciliation platform that ingests multi-gateway payment events, normalizes them across different schemas, reconciles transactions to bank/GL systems, surfaces exceptions in real-time, and exports clean, audit-ready records. Think "Resend for reconciliation" — dead-simple onboarding, pure API, usage-based pricing, composable adapters.

**Category:** Fintech / DevTools / Back-office automation (payment operations, finance engineering). Positioned at the intersection of payment infrastructure, developer tooling, and financial operations automation.

**Primary Users:**
- Payment engineers, backend engineers, staff engineers building payment infrastructure
- Founding engineers / CTOs doing their own infra in early-stage companies
- Finance/RevOps leaders who work closely with engineering teams

**Secondary Users:**
- Finance teams who need self-service reconciliation without constant engineering support
- Operations teams managing multi-platform payment workflows

**Stage:** MVP/pre-beta with design partners. Core reconciliation engine built, adapters for Stripe/Shopify/QuickBooks/PayPal operational, SDK and CLI available. Moving toward public beta with free tier (1K reconciliations/month).

**Core Job Settler Does:**
Ingest multi-gateway payment events (Stripe, PayPal, Shopify, bank CSVs, etc.), normalize them into a canonical schema, reconcile transactions against bank statements and accounting systems (QuickBooks, NetSuite), surface exceptions and mismatches, and export clean records with full audit trails. Handles webhook ingestion, retries, deduplication, FX conversion, fee calculation, and conflict resolution.

**Current Assumption on Monetization:**
SaaS + usage-based pricing (per reconciled transaction or event). Tiers by volume and number of integrations:
- Free: 1K reconciliations/month, 2 adapters
- Starter: $29/month (10K reconciliations, 5 adapters)
- Growth: $99/month (100K reconciliations, 15 adapters)
- Scale: $299/month (1M reconciliations, unlimited adapters)
- Enterprise: Custom pricing (unlimited, dedicated infra, compliance)

---

### B2. Persona Deep Dives

#### Persona 1: Alex – Payment Engineer at D2C Ecommerce Brand

**Name & Shorthand:**  
Alex – Payment Engineer at a $15M ARR D2C brand using Shopify + Stripe + PayPal + Klaviyo.

**Environment:**

*Stack:*
- Languages: TypeScript/Node.js (primary), Python (data pipelines)
- Frameworks: Next.js (storefront), Express/Fastify (backend APIs)
- Infrastructure: Vercel (frontend), AWS Lambda/ECS (backend), Postgres (RDS), Redis (ElastiCache)
- Deployment: GitHub Actions → Vercel/AWS, Docker containers
- Monitoring: Datadog, Sentry, PagerDuty

*Payment Landscape:*
- 3–4 gateways/rails: Stripe (primary), PayPal (refunds/alternative), Shopify Payments (some orders), bank transfers (B2B)
- Marketplaces: Shopify storefront, occasional Amazon FBA
- Payout patterns: Daily Stripe payouts, weekly PayPal, monthly bank transfers
- Volume: ~50K transactions/month, peaks at 200K/month during holidays
- Multi-currency: USD primary, EUR/GBP secondary

*Responsibilities:*
- Own payment integrations (Stripe, PayPal, Shopify Payments)
- Build and maintain webhook handlers for payment events
- Maintain reconciliation scripts (currently Python cron jobs)
- Debug payment discrepancies (finance pings Alex 2–3x/week)
- Optimize payment costs (gateway fees, FX rates)
- Ensure PCI compliance (no card storage, tokenization)
- Build internal dashboards for payment operations

**Jobs-to-be-Done Around Reconciliation:**

1. **"Implement multi-gateway reconciliation that finance can trust without spending months building custom logic."**
   - Finance needs daily reconciliation reports (Shopify orders ↔ Stripe payments ↔ PayPal refunds)
   - Currently takes 2–3 hours/day manually, finance wants it automated
   - Alex built a Python script but it breaks whenever Shopify/Stripe APIs change

2. **"Expose a reliable internal API/data model for transactions, settlements, fees, FX, refunds, chargebacks that other teams can consume."**
   - Product team needs transaction data for analytics
   - Customer support needs to look up payment status
   - Finance needs settlement data for accounting
   - Currently scattered across Stripe Dashboard, PayPal Dashboard, Shopify admin

3. **"Reduce manual spreadsheet/CSV merges owned by engineers whenever something breaks."**
   - When webhooks fail, finance exports CSVs and asks Alex to merge/match
   - Takes 1–2 hours per incident, happens 2–3x/month
   - Alex wants this to be self-service for finance

**Current Approach & Workarounds:**

*What They Do Today:*
- Direct Stripe/PayPal/Shopify API integrations via official SDKs
- Custom Python reconciler script (runs daily via cron, matches on `order_id` + `amount`)
- Webhook handlers in Express (stores events in Postgres, retries on failure)
- Ad-hoc data models: `transactions` table in Postgres (normalized manually)
- CSV exports from Stripe/PayPal when webhooks fail (manual merge in Excel)
- Finance uses QuickBooks but Alex doesn't integrate directly (finance does manual entry)

*Pain Points (Developer View):*

1. **Time Sinks:**
   - Building reconciliation logic: Spent 2 weeks building Python script, breaks every 3–4 months when APIs change
   - Maintaining webhook handlers: Debugging dropped webhooks, handling retries, idempotency
   - Debugging mismatches: Finance finds discrepancies, Alex spends 1–2 hours tracing through logs/APIs
   - Adding new gateways: Each new PSP requires new schema, new matching logic, new error handling

2. **Complexity:**
   - Event schemas: Stripe uses `charge.succeeded`, PayPal uses `PAYMENT.SALE.COMPLETED`, Shopify uses `orders/create` — all different shapes
   - Settlement timing: Stripe settles daily, PayPal weekly, bank transfers monthly — hard to match across time windows
   - FX handling: Stripe charges in USD but customer pays in EUR, need to convert and match
   - Fees: Stripe takes 2.9% + $0.30, PayPal takes 3.4% + fixed, Shopify takes 2.6% — different fee structures
   - Refunds/chargebacks: Different event types, partial refunds, chargeback fees — complex state machine

3. **Fragility:**
   - Webhooks dropped: Network issues, API rate limits, webhook endpoint downtime → missing events
   - Cron failures: Python script crashes, cron doesn't alert → reconciliation doesn't run
   - Inconsistent data: Stripe has `customer_email`, PayPal has `payer.email`, Shopify has `customer.email` → manual mapping
   - API changes: Stripe deprecates webhook format, Shopify changes order schema → script breaks

4. **Tension with Finance:**
   - Finance needs accuracy: "Why is there a $50 discrepancy?" → Alex spends hours debugging
   - Finance needs speed: "Can we get daily reports by 9 AM?" → Alex needs to wake up early to run script
   - Finance needs self-service: "Can I add a new matching rule?" → Alex needs to modify code
   - Devs need to ship features: "Can you fix the payment bug?" → Alex is busy debugging reconciliation

**Desired Outcomes (Developer View):**

1. **"One API/SDK to handle all reconciliation logic so I can stop reinventing it."**
   - Single SDK (`@settler/sdk`) that handles Stripe, PayPal, Shopify, bank CSVs
   - No need to write matching logic, FX conversion, fee calculation
   - Just configure adapters and matching rules, Settler handles the rest

2. **"Easy to add new providers without rewriting schema + logic."**
   - Add new gateway = configure adapter, Settler normalizes to canonical schema
   - No code changes needed for new providers (just config)

3. **"Clear, testable contracts for reconciliation behavior (unit/integration tests)."**
   - Can write tests: "Given Stripe charge + Shopify order, expect matched reconciliation"
   - Can mock Settler API in tests
   - Can verify reconciliation logic without running full integration

4. **"Finance can self-serve without pinging me for every discrepancy."**
   - Finance can view reports, configure matching rules (via UI or API)
   - Finance gets alerts on mismatches, can investigate without Alex
   - Finance can export data to QuickBooks without Alex's help

#### Persona 2: Jordan – Backend Engineer at SaaS Company

**Name & Shorthand:**  
Jordan – Backend Engineer at a $12M ARR B2B SaaS company using Stripe Billing + Recurly + QuickBooks.

**Environment:**

*Stack:*
- Languages: Go (primary backend), TypeScript (some services)
- Frameworks: Go standard library + Gorilla Mux, Next.js (admin dashboard)
- Infrastructure: AWS (ECS Fargate), Postgres (RDS), Redis (ElastiCache), SQS (queues)
- Deployment: GitHub Actions → ECS, Docker containers, Terraform for infra
- Monitoring: CloudWatch, Datadog, PagerDuty

*Payment Landscape:*
- 2–3 gateways/rails: Stripe Billing (subscriptions), Recurly (some enterprise customers), bank wires (enterprise)
- Recurring billing: Monthly/annual subscriptions, usage-based billing, prorations
- Payout patterns: Stripe daily, Recurly weekly, bank wires monthly
- Volume: ~30K transactions/month (mostly recurring), ~5K one-time payments
- Multi-currency: USD primary, EUR/GBP for international customers

*Responsibilities:*
- Own billing/payment infrastructure (Stripe Billing, Recurly)
- Build subscription lifecycle management (trials, upgrades, downgrades, cancellations)
- Maintain revenue recognition logic (ASC 606 compliance)
- Reconcile Stripe/Recurly to QuickBooks (currently manual, finance does it)
- Debug billing discrepancies (customer complaints, finance questions)
- Build internal tools for finance (revenue reports, churn analysis)

**Jobs-to-be-Done Around Reconciliation:**

1. **"Automate subscription revenue reconciliation so finance doesn't need to manually match Stripe invoices to QuickBooks."**
   - Finance spends 4–5 hours/week matching Stripe subscriptions to QuickBooks revenue
   - Jordan built a script but it doesn't handle prorations, upgrades, downgrades correctly
   - Finance wants daily automated reconciliation

2. **"Ensure revenue recognition compliance (ASC 606) without building complex logic ourselves."**
   - Need to recognize revenue over subscription period (not all at once)
   - Need to handle upgrades/downgrades, prorations, refunds
   - Currently finance does this manually in QuickBooks, error-prone

3. **"Provide finance with a single source of truth for subscription revenue data."**
   - Finance needs: MRR, ARR, churn, upgrades, downgrades
   - Currently scattered across Stripe Dashboard, Recurly Dashboard, QuickBooks
   - Jordan built a dashboard but it's not always accurate

**Current Approach & Workarounds:**

*What They Do Today:*
- Stripe Billing API for subscriptions (webhooks for `invoice.paid`, `customer.subscription.updated`)
- Recurly API for enterprise customers (webhooks for `new_subscription_notification`, `renewal_notification`)
- Custom Go service that processes webhooks, stores in Postgres
- Finance manually exports Stripe invoices, imports to QuickBooks (4–5 hours/week)
- Jordan built a Python script to match Stripe → QuickBooks but it's brittle

*Pain Points (Developer View):*

1. **Time Sinks:**
   - Building revenue recognition logic: Complex ASC 606 rules, prorations, upgrades/downgrades
   - Maintaining reconciliation scripts: Breaks when Stripe/Recurly APIs change
   - Debugging billing discrepancies: Customer says "I was charged twice" → Jordan spends hours tracing through webhooks

2. **Complexity:**
   - Subscription lifecycle: Trials, active, past_due, canceled, unpaid — complex state machine
   - Prorations: Upgrade mid-cycle, downgrade mid-cycle — need to calculate prorated amounts
   - Revenue recognition: Need to recognize revenue over subscription period, not all at once
   - Multi-currency: Stripe charges in USD, customer pays in EUR — FX conversion needed

3. **Fragility:**
   - Webhook ordering: Stripe sends `invoice.paid` before `customer.subscription.updated` → race conditions
   - Idempotency: Duplicate webhooks cause double-counting → need idempotency keys
   - API rate limits: Stripe rate limits → webhook processing fails → missing events

4. **Tension with Finance:**
   - Finance needs accuracy: "Why is MRR different in Stripe vs QuickBooks?" → Jordan spends hours debugging
   - Finance needs compliance: "Are we ASC 606 compliant?" → Jordan doesn't know, finance does manual work
   - Finance needs speed: "Can we get daily revenue reports?" → Jordan needs to build dashboard

**Desired Outcomes (Developer View):**

1. **"Automated subscription reconciliation that handles prorations, upgrades, downgrades correctly."**
   - Settler handles subscription lifecycle, prorations, revenue recognition
   - Finance gets daily reconciliation reports automatically

2. **"ASC 606 compliance without building complex logic."**
   - Settler handles revenue recognition rules, finance can trust the reports

3. **"Single source of truth for subscription revenue data."**
   - Settler normalizes Stripe + Recurly → canonical schema
   - Finance can query Settler API for MRR, ARR, churn, etc.

## Task C – Secondary Research Enrichment (Dev + Fintech)

### C1. Devtools & Infrastructure Patterns

**Common Patterns for Developer Adoption in Tools Like Settler:**

**Developers Care About:**

1. **API Quality:**
   - RESTful design, clear endpoints, consistent error handling
   - Versioning strategy (semantic versioning, `/v1/`, `/v2/`)
   - Rate limiting transparency (headers, clear limits)
   - Idempotency guarantees (idempotency keys, retry safety)

2. **Documentation:**
   - API reference (OpenAPI/Swagger, Postman collections)
   - Code examples (TypeScript, Python, Go, Ruby)
   - Quickstart guides ("first reconciliation in <30 minutes")
   - Integration recipes (common patterns, best practices)
   - Changelog (breaking changes, deprecations)

3. **Observability:**
   - Logs (structured JSON, searchable, retention)
   - Metrics (API latency, error rates, reconciliation accuracy)
   - Tracing (request IDs, distributed tracing)
   - Debugging tools (CLI, dashboard, replay events)

4. **Integration with Existing Stack:**
   - SDKs for popular languages (TypeScript, Python, Go, Ruby)
   - Framework integrations (Next.js, Express, FastAPI)
   - Deployment platforms (Vercel, AWS, GCP)
   - CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)

5. **No Nasty Surprises in Pricing:**
   - Transparent pricing (usage-based, clear tiers)
   - Free tier for testing (generous enough to evaluate)
   - Predictable costs (no hidden fees, overage pricing clear)
   - Cost calculator (estimate monthly costs)

**Behavior Patterns:**

1. **Try New Tools in Side Projects:**
   - Developers test new tools in personal projects or side projects first
   - Low-friction signup (GitHub OAuth, email signup)
   - Generous free tier (enough to build real project)
   - Sandbox mode (test without affecting production)

2. **Prefer Incremental Adoption:**
   - Start with one gateway/use case (Stripe only)
   - Expand gradually (add PayPal, then Shopify)
   - Don't want to migrate everything at once
   - Need escape hatch (can export data, can self-host if needed)

3. **Strong Aversion to "Closed Black Boxes" for Core Financial Logic:**
   - Need to understand how reconciliation works (matching rules, confidence scores)
   - Need to debug mismatches (why didn't this match?)
   - Need to customize logic (custom matching rules, conflict resolution)
   - Need audit trail (what matched, what didn't, why)

**High Confidence Patterns (Supported by Industry Research):**
- Developers prefer API-first tools over UI-only tools (Stripe, Twilio, Resend success)
- Quick time-to-value is critical (< 30 minutes to first successful call)
- Observability is non-negotiable (logs, metrics, debugging tools)
- Transparent pricing drives adoption (usage-based, clear tiers)

**Needs Primary Validation:**
- How important is self-hosting option? (Some devs want it, others don't care)
- How much customization do devs need? (Some want full control, others want opinionated defaults)
- What's the threshold for "too expensive"? (Varies by company size, use case)

---

### C2. Payment & Reconciliation Patterns

**General Realities (Without Naming Specific Sources):**

**Multi-Gateway, Multi-Rail Reality:**

1. **Many Merchants/SaaS Use Several PSPs/APMs:**
   - Stripe (primary), PayPal (alternative/refunds), Square (in-person), Apple Pay (mobile)
   - Local payment rails (SEPA in EU, ACH in US, BACS in UK)
   - Bank transfers (B2B, enterprise customers)
   - Marketplaces (Shopify Payments, Amazon Pay)

2. **Each Has Distinct APIs, Events, Payout Cadences, Fee/FX Behaviors:**
   - Stripe: REST API, webhooks, daily payouts, 2.9% + $0.30, handles FX
   - PayPal: REST API, IPN/webhooks, weekly payouts, 3.4% + fixed, FX conversion
   - Shopify: GraphQL API, webhooks, daily payouts, 2.6% + fixed, no FX
   - Bank transfers: CSV exports, manual reconciliation, no APIs

3. **Settlement Timing Varies:**
   - Stripe: Daily (next-day settlement)
   - PayPal: Weekly (7-day settlement)
   - Bank transfers: Monthly (30-day settlement)
   - Creates timing mismatches (charge on Day 1, settlement on Day 2–30)

**Manual Reconciliation Prevalence:**

1. **High Proportion of Finance Teams Still Rely on Spreadsheets:**
   - Export Stripe CSV, export PayPal CSV, export Shopify CSV
   - Manual merge in Excel, VLOOKUP to match transactions
   - Error-prone (miss transactions, duplicate matches, wrong matches)
   - Time-consuming (2–5 hours/day for mid-market companies)

2. **Developers Often Get Pulled In to Debug Mismatches:**
   - Finance finds discrepancy → pings engineer → engineer spends 1–2 hours debugging
   - Engineer traces through webhooks, API logs, database queries
   - Happens 2–3x/week for companies with multi-gateway setups
   - Takes focus away from product development

3. **Custom Reconciliation Scripts Are Common but Brittle:**
   - Many companies build Python/Node.js scripts to automate reconciliation
   - Scripts break when APIs change (Stripe deprecates webhook format, Shopify changes schema)
   - Scripts don't handle edge cases (partial refunds, chargebacks, FX conversion)
   - High maintenance burden (engineer spends 1–2 days/month fixing scripts)

**Pain Amplification at Scale:**

1. **As Volume and Number of Gateways Grow, Custom Solutions Buckle:**
   - Performance: Scripts that work at 1K transactions/month don't work at 100K+
   - Correctness: Edge cases multiply (FX, fees, refunds, chargebacks, prorations)
   - Maintainability: More gateways = more code = more bugs = more maintenance
   - Reliability: Webhook failures, API rate limits, network issues → missing events

2. **Finance Demands Increase:**
   - Need daily reconciliation (not weekly/monthly)
   - Need real-time alerts (not batch reports)
   - Need audit trails (for compliance, audits)
   - Need self-service (not engineer-dependent)

**High Confidence Patterns (Supported by Industry Research):**
- Multi-gateway is standard (not exception) for ecommerce/SaaS companies
- Manual reconciliation is still prevalent (spreadsheets, CSV exports)
- Custom scripts are common but brittle (high maintenance, breaks often)
- Scale amplifies pain (performance, correctness, maintainability issues)

**Needs Primary Validation:**
- What's the threshold for "too many gateways"? (3? 5? 10?)
- How important is real-time vs batch reconciliation? (Varies by use case)
- What compliance requirements matter most? (SOC 2? PCI-DSS? GDPR? ASC 606?)

---

### C3. Mapping Patterns Back to Personas
