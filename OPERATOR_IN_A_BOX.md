## 0. Context Snapshot (Settler)

**Product:** Settler – Developer-first, API-native, real-time payment reconciliation layer for multi-gateway, multi-rail ecommerce/SaaS.

**Targets:**
- **Primary:** Developers & payment engineers at D2C brands, SaaS companies, and platforms processing 1,000+ transactions/month across multiple systems
- **Secondary:** Finance leaders (CFOs, Finance Directors) who care about reconciliation latency, accuracy, and auditability

**Core Pains:**
- Multi-gateway fragmentation (Stripe, PayPal, Square, Shopify all have different data formats)
- Manual spreadsheet reconciliation taking 2-3 hours daily
- Long month-end close cycles (5-7 days)
- FX/fee opacity (hidden fees, currency conversion discrepancies)
- Disputes and chargebacks hard to track across systems
- Brittle custom recon logic that breaks with API changes

**Model:** SaaS + usage-based pricing (per transaction/reconciliation event)
- Free: 1K/month
- Starter: $29/month (10K/month)
- Growth: $99/month (100K/month)
- Scale: $299/month (1M/month)
- Enterprise: Custom (unlimited)

**Stage:** MVP in progress – Core API functional, adapters for Stripe/Shopify/PayPal/QuickBooks/Square, TypeScript SDK, CLI, web UI in development. OpenTelemetry instrumentation present. Ready for 2-3 design partners.

**Key Differentiators:**
- 5-minute API integration vs. weeks of custom code
- Real-time reconciliation vs. batch processing
- Composable adapters (Lego-block architecture)
- Developer-first DX (SDK, CLI, playground)

### 1.2 Brutal Critique

#### Critical Friction Points

**1. API Key Onboarding**
- **Issue:** API key shown once, no easy way to regenerate if lost
- **Impact:** High activation friction
- **Severity:** H
- **Fix:** Add "Regenerate" button, show masked key in list, allow multiple keys

**2. Adapter Configuration Ambiguity**
- **Issue:** Docs show `config: { apiKey: "..." }` but don't specify required vs. optional fields per adapter
- **Impact:** High activation friction (developers guess config)
- **Severity:** H
- **Fix:** Schema validation errors with specific field requirements, adapter-specific docs

**3. Error Messages Too Generic**
- **Issue:** API returns `ValidationError` but doesn't explain which field failed
- **Impact:** High activation friction (trial-and-error debugging)
- **Severity:** H
- **Fix:** Detailed error responses with field-level validation messages

**4. No Test Mode Toggle**
- **Issue:** No clear way to test without using production API keys
- **Impact:** High activation friction (fear of breaking production)
- **Severity:** H
- **Fix:** Test mode toggle in dashboard, sandbox environment

**5. Report Format Overwhelming**
- **Issue:** JSON response with nested structures may confuse non-technical users
- **Impact:** Medium retention friction (finance users can't understand results)
- **Severity:** M
- **Fix:** Visual report UI, summary cards, drill-down views

**6. Missing Trust Anchors**
- **Issue:** No visible indicators of accuracy, compliance, or auditability
- **Impact:** High trust friction (finance won't trust automated reconciliation)
- **Severity:** H
- **Fix:** Accuracy badges, confidence scores explained, audit trail visible, SOC 2 badge

**7. No Real-Time Status**
- **Issue:** No way to see reconciliation progress in real-time
- **Impact:** Medium activation friction (users don't know if it's working)
- **Severity:** M
- **Fix:** SSE endpoint for status updates, progress bar in UI

**8. Exception Queue Missing**
- **Issue:** No UI for reviewing unmatched transactions
- **Impact:** High retention friction (can't resolve issues)
- **Severity:** H
- **Fix:** Exception queue UI with filters, bulk actions, resolution workflow

#### Missing "WTF?" Moments

1. **"How do I know this is accurate?"**
   - Missing: Confidence scores, accuracy metrics, comparison with manual reconciliation

2. **"What if I need to change matching rules?"**
   - Missing: Rules editor UI, preview mode, impact analysis

3. **"How do I handle partial matches?"**
   - Missing: Partial match handling docs, examples

4. **"What happens if an adapter API changes?"**
   - Missing: Versioning strategy, breaking change notifications

5. **"How do I reconcile multi-currency transactions?"**
   - Missing: FX conversion docs, currency-aware matching examples

#### Developer Bounce Points

1. **Too Much Ceremony:** Sign-up → Email verification → API key → SDK install → Config → Test
   - **Fix:** One-click playground (no sign-up), pre-filled examples

2. **Unclear Next Step:** After creating job, what next?
   - **Fix:** Onboarding checklist, "Next steps" prompts

3. **Missing Code Examples:** Docs show API but not real-world examples
   - **Fix:** Examples repo, copy-paste snippets, recipes

### 2.3 Implementation Guidance

#### Where to Instrument

**Frontend (Web UI):**
- Use analytics library (PostHog, Mixpanel, or custom)
- Track page views, clicks, form submissions
- Send events to backend API endpoint: `POST /api/v1/events`

**Backend API:**
- Middleware to track API calls (already have observability middleware)
- Add business event logging: `logBusinessEvent(eventName, properties)`
- Store in `events` table or send to analytics service

**Workers (Reconciliation Jobs):**
- Track job execution events (start, success, error)
- Include job metadata (adapter, duration, accuracy)
- Send to event bus or analytics service

**SDK:**
- Optional: Track SDK usage (version, method calls)
- Send to backend: `POST /api/v1/events` (with user context)

#### Event Storage

**Option 1: Database Table (Simple)**
```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  event_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  properties JSONB,
  timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_events_user_timestamp ON events(user_id, timestamp);
CREATE INDEX idx_events_name_timestamp ON events(event_name, timestamp);
```

**Option 2: Analytics Service (Scalable)**
- Use PostHog, Mixpanel, or Amplitude
- Send events via API
- Use for real-time dashboards

**Option 3: Event Store (Advanced)**
- Already have event sourcing infrastructure
- Extend `event_store` table to include business events
- Use for audit trail + analytics

#### Health Checks

**Tracking Health:**
1. **Event Volume Check:** Daily event count should be >0 (if no events, tracking broken)
2. **Event Completeness:** % of users with events (should be 100% for active users)
3. **Event Latency:** Time from event occurrence to storage (should be <1s)
4. **Missing Events:** Check for gaps in expected event sequences (e.g., SignupCompleted without EmailVerified)

**Alerts:**
- Event volume drops >50% day-over-day
- Missing critical events (e.g., no ReconciliationSuccess events for 24h)
- Event storage latency >5s
