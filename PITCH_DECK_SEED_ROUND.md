## Slide 3: Why Existing Solutions Fail

**Headline:**  
# The Gap in the Market

**Visual:**  
- Competitive matrix table (clean, easy to read)
- Visual showing where Settler fits (center, highlighted)

**Content:**

| Solution | Why It Fails |
|----------|--------------|
| **QuickBooks/Xero** | Manual process, no real-time, limited API |
| **Stripe Revenue Recognition** | Stripe-only, no multi-platform |
| **Fivetran** | Not purpose-built for reconciliation, expensive |
| **Custom Scripts** | High maintenance, no compliance, brittle |
| **BlackLine** | Expensive ($100K+), complex, slow onboarding |

**The Gap:**  
No API-first, real-time, composable reconciliation service.

**Speaker Notes:**
- QuickBooks/Xero: "Manual, not real-time, limited API"
- Stripe: "Single-platform, not multi-platform"
- Fivetran: "Not purpose-built, expensive, requires data warehouse"
- Custom Scripts: "High maintenance, no compliance, brittle"
- BlackLine: "Expensive ($100K+), complex, 6-month setup"
- **The gap:** "No API-first competitor exists - this is our opportunity"

**Competitive Moat:**
- API-first architecture (competitors are UI-first)
- Real-time reconciliation (competitors are batch-based)
- Composable adapters (competitors are closed systems)
- Developer experience (5-minute integration vs. weeks/months)
