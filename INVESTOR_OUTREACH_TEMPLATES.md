## Email Templates

### Template 1: Cold Outreach Email

**Subject:** Settler - API-First Reconciliation Platform (Seed Round)

**Body:**

Hi [Investor Name],

I'm [Your Name], Founder & CEO of Settler. We're building the first API-first reconciliation platform that automates financial data matching across fragmented SaaS and e-commerce ecosystems.

**The Problem:**
Finance teams spend 2-3 hours daily manually matching transactions between platforms like Stripe, Shopify, and QuickBooks. This leads to revenue leakage, compliance risks, and wasted time.

**Our Solution:**
Settler is Reconciliation-as-a-Service - a simple API that connects any platform and automatically reconciles transactions in real-time. Think "Resend for reconciliation" - dead-simple onboarding, pure API, usage-based pricing.

**Traction:**
- 50+ beta users actively using the product
- 5+ Letters of Intent from target customers
- 98.7% reconciliation accuracy
- <5 minute time-to-value
- 30% trial-to-paid conversion rate

**The Ask:**
We're raising a $2M Seed Round to accelerate product development (10+ adapters, ML features) and go-to-market (content, partnerships, sales). We're looking for investors with fintech/SaaS experience who can help with GTM.

**Why Now:**
- MVP complete, strong product-market fit signals
- Market timing: API economy maturity, multi-platform adoption
- Competitive window: No API-first competitor exists
- $2.3B market, growing 12% YoY

I'd love to share our pitch deck and schedule a 15-minute call to discuss. Would you be open to a brief conversation?

Best regards,  
[Your Name]  
Founder & CEO, Settler

## Common Investor Questions & Answers

### Q: Why now?
**A:** Three reasons: (1) MVP complete with strong product-market fit signals (TTV <5 min, 30% conversion), (2) Market timing - API economy maturity and multi-platform adoption, (3) Competitive window - no API-first competitor exists.

**A:** Five defensible moats: (1) Network effects (more adapters → more customers → better algorithms), (2) Developer experience (5-minute integration vs. weeks), (3) Compliance (SOC 2, GDPR, PCI-DSS built-in), (4) Technical (real-time, composable, serverless), (5) Data (patterns → better algorithms).

### Q: How do you scale?
**A:** Three-phase GTM: (1) Developer-led growth (Product Hunt, content, partnerships), (2) Product-led growth (free tier, self-service), (3) Sales-assisted growth (enterprise sales, partnerships). Target: 1K → 5K → 20K users over 3 years.

### Q: What's your path to $100M ARR?
**A:** Clear, defensible growth model: Year 1 ($600K ARR) → Year 2 ($2.4M ARR) → Year 3 ($12M ARR) → Path to $100M ARR through market expansion, platform expansion (beyond reconciliation), and network effects.

### Q: Who are your competitors?

### Q: What are the key risks?
